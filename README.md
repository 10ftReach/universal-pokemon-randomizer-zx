Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX by Ajarmar

# Purpose
The purpose of this fork is to fix minor issues, but also to rebalance/change some things. As such, you might find that some of the things that are changed are not necessarily _better,_ but rather just different. Regardless, these changes have the goal of making the randomizer more fun to play, so hopefully you (the person reading this) will agree that the changes are good.

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) for changelogs.

Please note that this fork was made just because I wanted to make the races with my race crew more fun, and I don't want it to be more ambitious than that. Additions/updates will be done at my discretion, so don't contact me to tell me to add things to the randomizer. Thanks!
